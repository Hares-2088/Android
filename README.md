# EasyStay

## Team: 

Adem Bessam, Charles Seguin

## Description:

An application to book a room in the hotel you want. The app will show many Hotels and their ratings, prices and locations. The users would first be the owners of the hotels and second their customers would be the main operators of the application.

## Plan

In the next weeks, we will create a template for the user interface, or at least on Figma, and work on the logic behind booking a room.
